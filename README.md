Throughout the years, I have taken an interest in a variety of computer languages.  From my time in my undergraduate studies when I learned C++ and Visual Basic, to my self-taught years of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the "browser wars" years.  This has led me to a place where I am now and that is as a manager of a small team of developers for the City of South Bend. The cool thing about that role is the ability to not be stuck in one framework or one area of development. We get to build a number of small projects that use everything from T-SQL to Python to JavaScript and support a number of frameworks and libraries for each language. 

Check out what I know, what I am working on, and what I am trying to learn below
