Throughout the years, I have taken an interest in a variety of computer languages.  From my time in my undergraduate studies when I learned C++ and Visual Basic, to my self-taught years of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the "browser wars" years.  This interest has continued to where it has helped me land a position at Promineo Tech, where I help develop out coding problems in Java, MySQL, and Spring Boot; review and assist in creating updated Spring Boot materials that are used throughout various community colleges.  Additionally, I assist students in these same areas by serving as a coding mentor.  

Outside of my work as a Spring Boot/ Java Curriculum Specialist, I am working on a few personal projects that are listed below in addition to a few freelance projects that are geared more towards the front-end side of things.  

Check out what I know, what I am working on, and what I am trying to learn below

## Iâ€™m currently working on ...
